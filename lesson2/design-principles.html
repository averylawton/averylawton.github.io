        <h3>Tinker</h3>

        <p>In the website Tinker, they use whitespace to clearly separate items, add visual interest to icons,
             and create a professional layout for any device size.
              The most notable use of whitespace is the space in between information and pictures. 
              It makes for a long scroll time, but the sparciety of information between each scroll makes 
              the reader take in everything on the page. It is also worthy to note that the images on
               the page are often cutouts, not square pictures. Doing this, there is more whitespace
                to bring consistency to the overall design.

        <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>  
        <h3>On the Grid</h3>

        <p>
            The website On the Grid uses contrast in an original and interesting way. By using
             interactive pictures with high contrast, they made a more unique user experience.
              In one picture I have my mouse hovered over a box so readers can see an example of
               what I am speaking of. Along with the blue and white boxes, the website uses an 
               array of different colors that add to the designâ€™s contrast.

        <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>  
        <h3>Stereo</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.stereo.ca/">Stereo home page</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Stereo, a French website, uses proximity skillfully and consistently.
             Throughout the home page design, the information is organized in
              beautifully designed boxes. Each of the boxes has a headline, a 
              brief sentence of information, a picture, and a link leading to a page
               where you can learn more.
